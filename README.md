# My Codewars Problems
The JavaScript file in this repository contains all of my Codewars functions that I have completed. I thought about making each one into a separate file, but this allows myself and others to search for specific methods and other code among all of the ones I have completed.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** JavaScript
Each problem has the Codewars problem in a comment block and some have some extra information noted in it about extra solutions or other related information regareding the question. After the comment block, is the code I submitted. Some have more than one solution that I made as well.

## Lessons Learned:
Doing these can become addicting. The more interesting or realistic questions are not usually the popular ones.
